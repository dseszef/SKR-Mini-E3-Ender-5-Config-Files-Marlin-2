## Connecting BL Touch to dedicated on-board port (PC14)

Below is a picture showing where to connect your BL Touch if you wish to use the dedicated on-board port. This not required but it leaves Z end stop port available if you want to repurpose it. In this case you need to **follow** **step 3** from the **Installation guide for Printers with BL Touch 3.1**.

**To do:**

* Create and test a common ground between buck converter and SKR Mini E3 board.

  

**Buck converter specs:**

- Type/name: LM2596HVS DC-DC step-down module
- Input Voltage: 4.5V ~ 53V
- Output Voltage: 3V ~ 40V
- Output Current: 3A (max)
- Conversion efficiency: 92%(the highest)
- Output Ripple: <30mV
- Switching frequency: 150KHz
- Operating Temperature: -45 ° ~ +85 °
- Size: 43mm * 21mm * 14mm (L * W* H)
